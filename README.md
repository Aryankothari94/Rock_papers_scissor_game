Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple Python implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors where the user competes against the computer. The game runs for 10 rounds and keeps track of the score to determine the winner.

Requirements
Python 3.x

How It Works
The user is asked to input their choice for each round:

r for Rock

p for Paper

s for Scissors

The computer randomly selects one of the three choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

The game compares the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine who wins the round.

After 10 rounds, the game will display the final result, showing the number of rounds won by the user and the computer.


Game Logic
Rock (1) beats Scissors (-1).

Scissors (-1) beats Paper (0).

Paper (0) beats Rock (1).

If both the user and the computer choose the same option, it's a draw.

How to Play
Run the script.

Enter your choice for each round:

Type r for Rock

Type p for Paper

Type s for Scissors

The game will automatically display the result for each round and keep track of the score.

After 10 rounds, the game will declare the winner based on the total score.
